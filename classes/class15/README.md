#Class 15: Agile

##Intro
In the most simple interpretation, agile is a project management methodology and attitude. 
When you go work full time on software the odds are very good that you will be using some version of agile. 
Agile in it's purest form is more of a set of attitudes than a step by step guide. 
Hopefully this document and this class will help convey some of these attitudes and philosophies. 

##Alternatives
Talking about agile is easier when you are first aware of what was the style before agile. 
In the past, software would be developed using what has become known as waterfall stragety. In this style, the project is tackled by first doing the requirements for the entire project, the design, then the code, and finally one giant release after which the only work on the project would be maintenance. This made sense when software was released largely on discs or even downloads with no updating. Now, however, we develop websites that can change at any frequency without any extra work beign done on the part of the user. There are lot of other components too, but a big part of agile rapid iteration and releases. Make things quickly and push your code to your users frequently, taking and responding to feedbak as you go. 

##Agile Manifesto
The agile manifesto is one publication that tries to specify some of the agile principles. 
They list these four piorities as being central to the agile methodology: 

- Individuals and interactions over Processes and tools
- Working software over Comprehensive documentation
- Customer collaboration over Contract negotiation
- Responding to change over Following a plan

##Scrum
As mentioned ealier, agile is more of a mindset and methodology than an actual set of instructions on exactly what to do. A very popular addition to agile that brings in more specific instructions is the scrum framework. In fact, scrum is used so often with agile that components of one are often mistaken for components of the other. What srum adds is a set of roles and events to your development process that are meant to help maximize your efficiency. It is worth noting that while there are "official" scrum methods, the actual use and implementation varies a good amount from company to company and even team to team.

###Stories
A big part of scrum is breaking down the tasks of a project into what are called stories. 
These stories could be features, bugs, learning about something, and so on.
