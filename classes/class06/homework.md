# Homework 6 (we skipped 5)

## Assignment

You're going to make Twitter! Not quite. But we're going to get closer than you think.

We're going to be a little more open-ended here, describing functionality and user experience rather than specific http endpoints.

### Requirements

A "twote" is a small piece of text written by a user. You can call it whatever you want, but probably not "tweet" for copyright reasons...

- The main page displays:
	- A list of all twotes, with the most recent at the top
		- Each twote displays text and the author
	- A form to post a twote
		- Including a display of the logged-in user
	- A list of all users
		- Clicking on a user highlights that user's twotes
	- A logout button

- The login page has:
	- A form to log in

- A user can:
	- Post a twote (the twote will appear at the top of the list without a page refresh)
	- Delete their twotes (a user can only delete their own twotes)
	- Logout (with the logout button)

You're also going to make your clone look something like this:

Using CSS! Some big things you should emulate:

- The 2-column display of twotes and users
- Each twote appears on its own line
- Add styling to the form! Default forms are ugly
- Nice fonts (see [Google fonts](https://www.google.com/fonts)) are a plus
- Try to follow principles from the reading
