#Lab 1: WikiMVC

##Intro
This lab will have 3 components: 
- Choosing a client-side Javascript framework and learning it 
- Constructing a wiki clone with certain functionallity in that framework
- Preparing a presentation to the class about what your chosen framework

The lab will be completed in pairs.

##Choosing a Framework
Each pair will be choosing a client side framework. Angular, Backbone (potentionally with Marionette), Ember, React,Flight, Knockout, an Riot are all valid options but there are many other options.
If you are unsure of a framework qualifies just check with us and we should be able to tell you very quickly. 

##Constructing a Wiki
You must construct a wikipedia-like clone. It should have the following functionallity:
- List out all pages on various topics that have pages
- Read any submitted pages and their content
- Allow users to submit new pages on topics
- Allow users to submit edits to pages
- Documentation for each major component
- Not look terrible
- One other feature you'd like to implement (Could be as simple as a random page or something more serious like searching, but we are urging creativity)

If you want to make the wiki have a special topic area (like harry potter or some game) you are encouraged to do so. 
Brownie points will be awarded for awesome looking websites whoose themes match the topic area, though have all the functionallity should come before making it pretty.

##Framework Presentation
You and your partner will get together with the other groups who are doing the same framework and create a 8-10 minute presentation about the framework. 
The goal of the presentation is NOT to teach the class to use the framework. 
Rather the presentation should contain the following pieces:
- Basic overview and introduction to the framework
- Any unique features that you believe are worth showing off
- What are some advantages of this framework
- What are some disadvantages / difficulties of the framework
- What type of project would the framework be suited or not suited for
- Anything else you believe the class should know about the framework
