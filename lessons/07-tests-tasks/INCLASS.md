#Lesson 8 In-Class Exercises

##Testing:
We've built a testing framework for the cat app with a few example tests (in the subdirectory `inclass`).
- Add tests for the rest of the cat app
- "Break" the cat app source code in several places to make sure your tests aren't passing when there are problem
- Trade cat apps with someone else and try to cause a problem in their code which their tests won't catch.

##Task running:
- Add a linter (e.g. [jslint](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jslint)) and/or a style checker (e.g. [jscs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jscs)) to the gruntfile, and fix your cat app code so it passes the linting/style check
- If you're interested, add a minification/bundling task
- Look into other types of tasks and add them.

If you're done, start the homework!
