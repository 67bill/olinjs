#Lesson 8 In-Class Exercises

##Testing:
We've built a testing framework for the cat app with a few example tests(see __directory__).
- Write tests for the rest of the cat app
- "Break" the cat app source code in several places to make sure your tests aren't passing when there are problem
- Trade cat apps with someone else and try to cause a problem in their code which their tests won't catch.

##Task running:
- Add a linter and/or a style checker to the gruntfile, and fix your cat app code so it passes the linting/style check
- If you're interested, add minification and code coverage tasks
- Look into other types of tasks and add them.

If you're done, start the homework.
