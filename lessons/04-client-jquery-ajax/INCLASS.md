#Lesson 5 In-Class Exercises

##Class 5 README
Because this readme was long and you needed to follow along, take some time to finish up your forms app or ask any questions if you need to. Push this to your fork. The solution to the walkthrough is in this class 05 folder as [formsAppWalkthrough](https://github.com/olinjs/olinjs/blob/master/lessons/04-client-jquery-ajax/formsAppWalkthrough). 


Pick the ones which are interesting and challenging to you, and feel free to work with the people around you. **If you feel done or comfortable with these, move on to the [homework](https://github.com/olinjs/olinjs/blob/master/lessons/04-client-jquery-ajax/HOMEWORK.md), since it's fairly lengthy.**
