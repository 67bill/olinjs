##In-class Exercises
1. Finish the tutorial in this readme and create a webapp that uses express and
handlebars to display a list of classes at Olin in your web browser. Build off
of the hello world application you did for homework. Once you have completed
this, show the teaching team your webapp in a browser.
2. There is a lot of repetitive setup and repeated code, called boilerplate
code, involved when you create a new webapp. Copy the files of the webapp you've created and remove or add code to create a boilerplate webapp that you will copy and paste to start the rest of the Express applications that you will create.
3. For this last exercise, you will be replicating one of the most sophisticated and powerful webapps the internet has ever seen: [https://isitchristmas.com/](https://isitchristmas.com).There are a few requirements, of course.
   -Your website should use Handlebars and change to tell the user YES or NO depending on whether it is Christmas.
   -The website title and favicon (what displays at the top of a tab in chrome) should be appropriately Christmassy. Do some googling first if you need help with the favicon!
   -You donâ€™t need to worry about timezones for now. Assume that everyone using this website is in the same timezone as your server.  
   -If you finish early, try your hand at these exercises:
        -Make sure that the response you send your user is centered, no matter how they resize their browser.
        -Send along some javascript so an animation of your choice occurs when you click on the page. For example, the text on the page could change to a random color when you click on it.
