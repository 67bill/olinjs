# Exercise 2

## Reading

Read the Node Beginner Book (in `Public/+Courses/Olinjs15/`) up to page 58 (the section marked **Handling file uploads** — the methods used there are old and no longer relevant). This resource ties together a lot of what we covered in class 1 by implementing a basic web server in Node. You'll learn how Node handles browser requests — and how Node is unique — while flexing your newly acquired JavaScript muscle. You should follow along by writing and running the code examples given.

Read the [Airbnb Javascript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript). Try to incorporate these styles into your work in this class.

## Assignment

Read and do the exercises in the first three sections of the [Lesson 3 Readme](https://github.com/olinjs/olinjs/tree/master/lessons/03-express-templates-mongo) to learn about Express, a development framework we will be using. Have a hello world express application finished and ready to show to the teaching team in your browser for next class. Note that you only need to do exercises in sections up to and including **Organizing an Express Application** to create this app.

Be ready to write down two things at the beginning of next class to help us identify difficult concepts that deserve more attention.
*Something in the assignment you felt confident about and easily grasped
*Something in the reading you're confused about or want to know more about

## Optional Reading

This is a fun, well-written article on how naming conventions affect the way we think and code: [Execution in the Kingdom of Nouns](http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2006/03/execution-in-kingdom-of-nouns.html).
